Prisma-reloaded
===============

This repository contains the source code for a grails web app showing decisions taken by greek government about _Thessaloniki_.
According to greek law L3861/2010 every greek organization is obligated to post every decision to https://diavgeia.gov.gr.
We are using the API provided by Diavgeia (https://diavgeia.gov.gr/api/help) to insert the data in our server (code in project #Prisma-4-thess/UpdatedCrawler).

Our goals are:
- to provide an easy and efficient search for the users
- to connect each decision to a geographical point in Thessaloniki
- to provide an portal for Thessaloniki Municipality employees to upload new decisions

The project contains an Android application (code in project #Prisma-4-thess/Prisma_Android).
